    This app uses L-Systems to draw 2D figures, like plants and fractals.
    Use the menu at the top to load examples and the bar at the bottom to control the number of iterations.

  <h2> How it works </h2>
  <p>
    An L-System consists of a starting symbol/symbols called the <em>axiom</em>, along with <em>production rules</em> which manipulate those symbols (this terminology comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">formal language theory</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    A production rule looks like this: 
    <span class=production-rule> A &rarr; AB </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    This rule simply replaces the symbol A with the word AB.
    Applying it to the string "A" generates the string "AB".
    Applying it again to the result yields  "ABB".
    Simple.

  </p>
  <p>
    Let's add another rule: <span class=production-rule> B &rarr; A </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now when we go through each character applying the appropriate rule the result looks like this:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    "A" &rarr; "AB" &rarr; "ABA" &rarr; "ABAAB" &rarr; <br> "ABAABABA"  &rarr; ...
  </p>
  <p>
    You can identify 'A' as an organism capable of reproduction (or a branch of a tree/stem of a plant etc.) and 'B' as the offspring (or new shoots on a tree/plant) then the first rule is just <em>reproduction</em> ('A' produces a 'B') and the second rule is kinda like <em>ageing</em> ('B' matures into an 'A').
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is already complex enough to describe a type of branching seen on some trees, root systems and plants, which have a Fibonacci sequence of branches/roots/stems just like the length of strings produced by this system.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <h2> Graphics </h2>
  <p>
    The next step is to turn these L-Systems into images.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way is the turtle interpretation, where the symbols in the strings are used as instructions that control a moving cursor (the turtle) around the screen, drawing lines as it moves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider this L-System (taken from The Alg. Beauty of Plants 1.24(a)):
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <div class="L-System">
      <span class=axiom>A</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr; A[+A]A[-A]A</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <span style="position:relative; left:420px; top:-76px;">  &larr; The Axiom </span>
  <span style="position:relative; left:320px; top:-33px;">  &larr; The Production rule(s)</span>
  <p>
    Running this system a couple times gives:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 1%;">
    A &rarr; A[+A]A[-A]A &rarr; A[+A]A[-A]A[+A[+A]A[-A]A]A[+A]A[-A]A[-A[+A]A[-A]A]A[+A]A[-A]A &rarr; ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we can draw this. 
    Whenever the turtle sees an 'A' it moves forward and whenever it sees +/- it turns left/right.
    The square brackets push/pop the turtle's current position, so it can draw something then return to where it was.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's all we need for the turtle to draw this:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <div class="side-by-side-3">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c1_1.png">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c1_2.png">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c1_3.png">
    </div>
    <figcaption>  The above L-system after one, two and three iterations. </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c1_5.png">
    <figcaption> The system after five iterations.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The turtle starts at the bottom of the figure, and draws one line at a time.
    We can now see graphically what the rule is doing: it takes each straight line 'A' and replaces it with the five line pattern 'A[+A]A[-A]A' you see in the first panel.
    Doing this repeatedly generates this self-similar plant-like structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making the rules slightly more complicated we get this (taken from The Alg. Beauty of Plants 1.24(c)):
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <div class="L-System">
      <span class=axiom>A</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr; AA-[-A+A+A]+[+A-A-A]</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <figure>
    <div class="side-by-side-3">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c2_1.png">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c2_2.png">
      <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c2_3.png">
    </div>
    <figcaption>  The above L-system after one, two and three iterations. </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c2_4.png">
    <figcaption> The system after four iterations.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This time you can see each straight line 'A' being replaced with the Y-like shape made of eight lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's get more symbols involved (taken from the Alg. Beauty of Plants 1.24(f)):
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <div class="L-System">
      <span class=axiom>B</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr; AA </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>B &rarr; A[+B]A[-B]+B</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <figure>
    <img class="hover-zoom" src="resources/c3_7.png">
    <figcaption> The system after seven iterations.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This time there is another symbol 'B' which is ignored by the turtle, but represents invisible 'nodes' that the plant structure grows from.
    This <em>node-rewriting</em> method generates structures which, at least to someone like me with no botany background, are looking pretty plant-like.
  </p>

  <h2> Randomness </h2>
  <p> 
    Using this method to generate plant images has a downside: all copies of a plant are totally identical, and graphics tricks like scaling and rotating can only help that so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    One solution is to incorporate randomness into the rules themselves, emulating how a plant may or may not grow depending on external factors (weather etc.).
    This creates plants with a more realistic diversity to them, while still feeling like the same species.
  </p>

  <div style="text-align:center">
    <div class="L-System">
      <span class=axiom>A</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr; (33%) A[+A]A[-A]A </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr;(33%)  A[+A]A </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class=production-rule>A &rarr;(33%)  A[-A]A </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This system can be viewed in the app above as "Stochastic branching".
    Hit 'new rng seed' to generate more variants.

  <h2> History </h2>
  <p>
    The L in L-system is named after Aristid Lindenmayer, a biologist who came up them to describe the growth of simple organisms like yeast and algae.
  </p>
  <p>
    These L-systems turned out to also be pretty good at describing the growth of larger things (trees/flowers/etc) which eventually caught the interest of the computer graphics community.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were the topic of lectures at SIGGRAPH in 1988 and 1989, and those lecture notes became a book, 'The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants', from which I originally discovered this concept.
  </p>

  <h2> TODO list </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> UI for contextual mapping (the app already supports it - see any of the context-sensitive examples). </li>
    <li> Parametric-matching. </li>
    <li> 3D drawing. </li>
  </ul>
